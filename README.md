## Troubleshooting

Depends on the operating system, something an error can occur when trying to copy/paste :

```
Pyperclip could not find a copy/paste mechanism for your system. 
Please see https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#not-implemented-error for how to fix this.
```

In that case, you may have to install `xclip` package :

```bash
sudo apt-get install xclip
```
